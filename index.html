        <figcaption>Painter and sculptor, artist and inventor, dreamer, visionary, genius. To inscribe the figure of Leonardo Da Vinci
          in a precise definition is an impossible task. No other historical figure has shown a lot of versatility, the indefatigable
          ingenuity in applying to almost every field of human knowledge.</figcaption>

          <h3>Brief History</h3>
        </a>
        <p>No one has been able to inspire many minds about him, no one has given a most admirable contribution to the development
          of the techniques of the arts and humanities.</p>

        <p>Born in 1452 in Anchiano, a small town near Florence, Leonardo began to approach the artist's career as an apprentice
          in the workshop of the great painter, Verrocchio. Admired and respected by princes and powerful, has been in the
          service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan and Giuliano de Medici to the Vatican and was host of the king of France,
          Francis I. The extraordinary collection of works he has left in the world is surpassed only by projects that did
          not have time to complete and for which there is no trace in his personal manuscripts.</p>

          <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        </a>
        <ol>
          <li>Leonardo loved water: He developed plans for floating snowshoes, a breathing device for underwater exploration,
            a life preserver, and a diving bell that could attack ships from below. In case one had to.</li>
          <li>Leonardo was the first to explain why the sky is blue. (It's because of the way air scatters light.)</li>
          <li>And he figured out why the entire moon is dimly visible when it is a thin crescent. Its nightside is lit by light
            reflected from Earth, which appears 50 times brighter from the moon than the full moon appears here.</li>
          <li>An ambidextrous, paranoid dyslexic, Leonardo could draw forward with one hand while writing backward with the other,
            producing a mirror-image script that others found difficult to read—which was exactly the point.</li>
          <li>He crushed intelligent design before anyone even thought of it: His studies of river erosion convinced him that
            the Earth is much older than the Bible implies, and he argued that falling sea levels—not Noah's Flood—left marine
            fossils on mountains.</li>
